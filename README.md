## Importing Liked Songs from Spotify Using Python

### Step 1: Install the Spotipy Library

First, install the `spotipy` library. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install spotipy
```

### Step 2: Set Up Spotify API Credentials

You need to register your application on the Spotify Developer Dashboard to get the necessary credentials:

1. Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).
2. Log in with your Spotify account.
3. Create a new app and note down the Client ID and Client Secret.

### Step 3: Authorize and Authenticate

Use the Spotipy library to authorize your application. Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID`, `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `YOUR_REDIRECT_URI` with your own details.

```python
import spotipy
from spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyOAuth

sp = spotipy.Spotify(auth_manager=SpotifyOAuth(client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
                                               client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
                                               redirect_uri="YOUR_REDIRECT_URI",
                                               scope="user-library-read"))
```

Make sure to set the `scope` to `"user-library-read"` to access liked songs.

### Step 4: Fetch Liked Songs

Now, you can fetch the liked songs:

```python
def get_liked_songs(sp):
    results = sp.current_user_saved_tracks()
    for idx, item in enumerate(results['items']):
        track = item['track']
        print(f"{idx + 1}. {track['artists'][0]['name']} â€“ {track['name']}")

# Call the function
get_liked_songs(sp)
```

This function will print a list of liked songs from your Spotify account.

### Notes

- Ensure your Spotify app has the necessary permissions set in the developer dashboard.
- The redirect URI in the Spotify application settings and your code should match.
- If you encounter a token error, check your credentials and the set scope.

This guide assumes basic familiarity with Python and the use of API keys. Remember to handle your credentials securely and never expose them in your code, especially in public repositories.
